# Salary Prediction Project

## Project Overview

* Created a tool that estimates salary for different Data Science roles to help with salary negotiation with future employer.

* Scrapped about 1000 job postings from glassdoor using python and selenium.

* Feature engineering done to quantify the postings which contained python, R, AWS, Spark, SQL, Tableau, Excel.

* Optimised Multiple Linear, Support Vector and Random Forest Regressors using RandomizedSearchCV.

* Built a client facing API using Flask.

## Resources

**Python Version** : 3.7.6

**Packages** :pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn, selenium, flask, json, pickle

**Web Framework Requirements** : pip install -r requirements.txt

## Web Scraping for job postings from Glassdoor.com

Scraped 1000 job postings from glassdoor.com. Following fields were scraped from each posting :

 * Job title
 * Salary Estimate
 * Job Description
 * Rating
 * Company
 * Location
 * Company Headquarters
 * Company Size
 * Company Founded Date
 * Type of Ownership
 * Industry
 * Sector
 * Revenue
 * Competitors
 
## Data Preprocessing

* Parsed numeric data out of salary
* Parsed rating out of company text
* Made a new column for company state
* Made columns for employer provided salary and hourly wages
* Removed job postings without salary
* Added a column for if the job was at the companyâ€™s headquarters
* Transformed founded date into age of company
* Made columns for if different skills were listed in the job description:
   * Python
   * SQL
   * Tableau
   * R
   * Excel
   * AWS
   * Spark
* Column for simplified job title and Seniority
* Column for description length

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Below are some of the important findings from the exploratory data analysis:

## Model Building and Evaluation

Categorical variables tranformed to dummy variables. 

Three different models built and tuned. Evaluation done through Mean Absolute Error(MAE).

Performance of the models is given below:

* **MAE for Multiple Linear Regression** : 19.67078838952545
* **MAE for Support Vector Regression** : 30.088913715302816
* **MAE for Random Forest** : 14.452240720416757

Random Forest gives least error and it also shows that it performs better on sparse matrix.

## Productionization

In the final step, I built a Flask API endpoint which is hosted locally with the help of article referenced above. The API endpoint can give the predicted salary based on the model we built from the list of features we give as input.
